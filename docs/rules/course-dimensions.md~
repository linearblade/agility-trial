# 🧭 Agility Trial Course Dimensions (Real-World vs Game Translation)

This document outlines the real-world standards for agility trial course dimensions and how they can be translated into a hex-based tile grid for gameplay in AlacritySim.

## 📏 Real-World Standard Course Dimensions

| Organization | Standard Ring Size | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| **AKC**      | **100 ft x 100 ft** max (30.5 x 30.5 m)  <br>**50 ft x 70 ft** min (15.2 x 21.3 m) | Depends on venue size |
| **USDAA**    | **100 ft x 100 ft** standard  <br>**70 ft x 120 ft** also used | Prefers large fields |
| **UKI**      | **30 m x 30 m** (98.4 ft x 98.4 ft) | Metric standard |
| **FCI**      | **20 m x 40 m** (65.6 ft x 131 ft) | International norm |

> ✅ The most common "default" ring is **100 ft x 100 ft**, or **minimum 50 ft x 70 ft**.

## 🔢 Real Course Details

- **Obstacles per course**: 12–20  
- **Obstacle spacing**: 18–22 ft apart (approx. 6–7 meters)
- **Course difficulty** is influenced by:
  - Obstacle layout and sequence
  - Angle and tightness of turns
  - Reversals or crossbacks

## 🕹️ Hex Grid Translation

### 🔸 Assumptions:
- **1 hex tile ≈ 3 ft** (approximate footprint of dog stride & obstacle width)

### 🔸 Grid Size Estimates:
| Real-World Area       | Approx Tile Grid |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| 50 ft x 70 ft         | 16 x 23 tiles    |
| 100 ft x 100 ft       | 33 x 33 tiles    |
| Balanced play area    | 20–25 tiles per side |

## 🧠 Game-Friendly Grid Design Guidelines

- Recommended **standard course size**: 24 x 24 hex grid  
- Keep **obstacle spacing** at ~6–7 tiles apart
- Obstacle tile usage:
  - **Jumps**: 1 tile
  - **Tunnels**: 2+ tiles (curved or straight)
  - **Weave poles**: 6+ tiles in a line
- Provide at least **3+ tiles of space** between most obstacles

## 🔧 Special Zones to Include

| Zone              | Purpose                         | Tile Size Suggestion |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Start Zone**    | Dog placement + lead-out area    | 3x2 or 3x3 tiles      |
| **Finish Area**   | Visual end of course             | 2–3 tiles wide        |
| **Out-of-Bounds** | Decorative or penalty space      | Optional border       |
| **Rest Zone**     | UI / handler spawn               | Optional side area    |

|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Course Size (standard)      | ~100 ft x 100 ft           | 30x30 hex grid (approx.)     |
| Course Size (small)         | ~50 ft x 70 ft             | 16x23 hex grid               |
| Obstacle Spacing            | 18–22 ft                   | 6–7 hex tiles                |
| Obstacles per Course        | 12–20                      | 12–20 tiles                  |
| Start + Finish Lines        | Fixed plane or cones       | Marked tile rows or zones    |
