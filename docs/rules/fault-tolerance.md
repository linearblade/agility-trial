# ⚠️ Fault Tolerance in Agility Trials

This document describes the expected level of fault tolerance in professional agility trials and how it applies to AlacritySim's scoring model. It provides realistic expectations for fault frequency, performance tiers, and competitive standards.

## 🧠 What is Fault Tolerance?

In agility scoring, **fault tolerance** refers to how many mistakes (faults) a dog and handler team can make while still qualifying, ranking, or progressing.

> In elite competition, **the tolerance for faults is extremely low.**

---

## 🎯 Competitive Expectations

| Competition Level         | Fault Expectation       | Notes |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **Local / Novice**        | 5–15 faults acceptable   | Focus is on learning and exposure |
| **Regional / Advanced**   | 0–10 faults common       | Some faults tolerated, but clean runs preferred |
| **National / Championship** | 0–5 faults tolerated   | Clean runs expected to place |
| **International (FCI, AWC)** | 0 faults standard     | Clean runs required to qualify |

---

## 🐾 Fault Impact at the Elite Level

- **1 bar down** can drop a team from 1st to 10th
- **1 refusal** can eliminate a podium finish
- **5 faults** is often the **difference between qualifying and elimination**
- **Clean = Competitive**, especially in finals rounds

---

## 📊 Clean Run Frequency by Round (Typical)

| Trial Stage        | % Clean Runs (Pro Field) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Preliminaries      | 50–70%                   |
| Semifinals         | 60–75%                   |
| Finals             | 80–90%                   |

> At high levels, most top teams run **clean or bust**.

---

## ❌ Non-Qualifying Scenarios (NQ)

A team is eliminated from qualification if any of the following occur:

- Wrong obstacle taken (off-course)
- Obstacle taken out of order
- Backjump
- Exceeds SCT by large margin
- 3 cumulative refusals (AKC) or judge-declared disengagement

---

## 🧮 AlacritySim Fault Policy

AlacritySim models real-world fault pressure by enforcing:

- **+5 seconds** per fault (runout, knock, refusal)
- **NQ on major mistakes** (wrong course, backjump)
- **SCT pressure** for time management

Players are encouraged to train for:

- Clean sequences
- Early cue timing
- Efficient pathing

## 🏁 Summary

| Faults In Run | Competitive Meaning              |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **0**          | 💎 Gold standard, podium-worthy   |
| **5**          | ⚠️ Acceptable, but risky          |
| **10+**        | ❌ Out of top-tier contention     |
| **NQ**         | 🔻 Disqualified                   |

Clean runs aren't just ideal — they’re **the cost of admission** at the top.
